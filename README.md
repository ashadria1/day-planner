Description:
The purpose of this exercise is to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  I'll be using the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with dates and times. 

Hypothetical:  I'm an employee with a busy schedule.  I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

Purpose:  If I am using a daily planner to create a schedule, when I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.  When I scroll down, I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours.  When I view the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.  When I click into a time block, I can enter an event.  When I click the save button for that time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage.  When I refresh the page, the saved events persist.
